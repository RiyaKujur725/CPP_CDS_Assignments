To Study and Implement C++ Decision Making Statements

ðŸ”¹ Aim To understand and implement various decision-making constructs in C++ such as if, if-else, nested if-else, and switch-case

ðŸ”¹ Observation Each program compiled successfully and produced correct outputs for different test inputs. The decision-making statements were used effectively to direct program flow based on conditions.

ðŸ”¹ Conclusion Decision-making statements in C++ allow programs to make logical choices and respond to different inputs dynamically. This experiment reinforced the usage of if, if-else, and switch-case in real-world scenarios.
