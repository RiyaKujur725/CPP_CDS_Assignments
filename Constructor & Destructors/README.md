##  AIM

To implement and understand various types of constructors and destructors in C++, including:

- Default Constructor  
- Parameterized Constructor  
- Copy Constructor  
- Constructor with User Input  
- Destructor  



## THEORY

In C++, constructors are special functions that are automatically called when an object is created. They are used to initialize the objectâ€™s data members. There are several types:

- **Default Constructor**: Initializes objects with default values and takes no parameters.
- **Parameterized Constructor**: Accepts arguments to initialize objects with specific values.
- **Copy Constructor**: Creates a new object as a copy of an existing object.
- **Constructor with User Input**: Uses `cin` to take values from the user during object creation.

A **Destructor** is a special function that is automatically called when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It is used to free resources and perform cleanup operations.



##  ALGORITHM



##  CONCLUSION

These experiments successfully demonstrate the use of constructors and destructors in C++. Each constructor type serves a unique purpose in object-oriented programming:

- The **default constructor** provides automatic initialization.  
- The **parameterized constructor** allows customized setup.  
- The **copy constructor** enables object duplication.  
- The **user-input constructor** facilitates dynamic initialization.  
- The **destructor** manages cleanup and illustrates object lifecycle.
