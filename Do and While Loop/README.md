AIM:
To understand basic C++ programming constructs through pattern printing, loops, and conditional statements.

APPLICATION USED : VS Code
THEORY:
These programs demonstrate C++ fundamentals like nested loops, character manipulation, conditionals, and pattern logic using for loops. Each code block illustrates different console outputs: alphabetical patterns, number sequences, and star pyramids.

PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS USED:

Nested for loops

Conditional statements (if)

Character and integer manipulation

Console I/O (cout)

ALGORITHM (General):

Start program

Initialize loop counters and pattern variables

Use nested loops to control rows and columns

Apply spacing or conditionals for desired pattern

Print results accordingly

End program

CONCLUSION:
These simple programs help in building foundational logic using loops and conditions, reinforcing understanding of flow control and output formatting in C++.
