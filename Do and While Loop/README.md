## AIM  
The aim of these **C++ programs** is to develop an understanding of **fundamental programming constructs** by creating simple pattern-based outputs and logic-based operations using **loops, conditionals, and character handling**.



## APPLICATION USED  
**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**



## THEORY  

C++ is a **general-purpose programming language** that supports both **structured** and **object-oriented programming**. It is widely used for **system/application software** and **game development**.  

In these programs, we explore basic concepts such as:  
- **Output formatting**  
- **Loop control structures (for loops)**  
- **Condition checking (if statements)**  

Each code snippet demonstrates a different logical structure â€” from **printing characters and patterns** to **identifying even numbers within a range**.  

**Pattern printing** often uses **nested loops**:  
- **Outer loop:** controls the number of rows.  
- **Inner loop:** controls the columns/content of each row.  
- **Spacing and character sequencing** are managed using counters and incremental logic.  



## PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS USED  

- **Input/Output Streams:** Using `cout` for displaying output  
- **Loops:** `for` loops for iteration  
- **Nested Loops:** Handling rows and columns in patterns  
- **Conditionals:** `if` conditions for filtering even numbers  
- **Character Manipulation:** Incrementing characters (e.g., `'A'++`) to print alphabet sequences  



## ALGORITHM (Generalized for Pattern Printing & Logic)

1. Start the program.  
2. Initialize variables for loop control (e.g., `i`, `j`, `n`).  
3. Use nested loops to print patterns:  
   - **Outer loop:** controls the number of rows.  
   - **Inner loop(s):** controls the content of each row (stars, spaces, characters).  
4. For logical tasks (e.g., even numbers):  
   - Loop through the range.  
   - Use `if (i % 2 == 0)` to check even numbers.  
   - Print numbers accordingly.  
5. End the program.  



## CONCLUSION  

Through these **C++ programs**, we explored the **core concepts of iterative programming, conditional execution, and console output formatting**.  

- **Pattern printing** enhances logical thinking and helps in mastering nested loops.  
- **Logical programs** (like even number identification) strengthen understanding of conditions.  

These basic exercises lay a strong **foundation for more complex algorithmic problem-solving** in programming.
